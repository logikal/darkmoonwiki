# Scuffing

On the G10 plate, if nothing else helps, you can try scuffing the plate to improve adhesion.

>[!WARNING]
> Do this under running water, or outside with proper ventilation/PPE. You _do not_ want to breathe in fiberglass/g10 dust.

Get some [0000 steel wool](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Devil-0320-Steel-Super/dp/B001JYVDSE) or [maroon scrotchbrite pads](https://www.amazon.com/QLXHBOT-General-Purpose-Sanding-Pads/dp/B0D5L6SCLF=).

Lightly scuff the surface of your plate.

Use a side
