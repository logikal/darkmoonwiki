# Reset the Bed Mesh

There's a firmware issue on Bambu Lab printers that sometimes causes the bed mesh to be incorrect, even if you're doing calibrations or automatic bed leveling. It seems to impact EU H2 series printers most often, but applies to all series.

This is especially common if you're using a different plate than you originally calibrated with.

1. Power off your printer for at least 30 seconds. **Do not skip this step!**
2. Power on your printer.
3. Make sure your Darkmoon plate is properly placed on the bed.
4. Run your printer's bed leveling calibrations
   1. on H2/P2, do both the normal and high-temp bed leveling calibrations.

Try your print again. This solves about 50% of issues we see in Discord.
